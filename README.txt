WELCOME!!!

THIS PROJECT, HECATE MAGISTER,
Takes its name from the Greek Goddess, Hecate. The other part of the name, Magister, means master or commander in latin. Thus, Master Hecate, or Commander Hecate.

This project is a stream deck alternative. Eventually this repository will include everything from CAD files for 3D printing, to parts lists and source code.

A few things about this project. For standardization purposes, certain file types will be standardized.
CAD Files:
TBD - must use something free and freely available. Probaly blender for at least some of these.

Drawings/Diagrams:
Drawings are done using draw.io. This will inlclude the initial mockups, and eventually UML diagrams as well.

Text files:
This project uses .txt or  .odt files for text files. This is because I am on linux and so am using Libre Office.
